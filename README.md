[Design-to-Code Bridge codebase](https://github.com/mirabelledoiron/Design-to-Code-Bridge) 

is a professional UX-Engineering tool designed to bridge the gap between design system variables and production-ready code. It automates the extraction, transformation, and distribution of design tokens to ensure high-fidelity implementation.

## The UXE Process: Design to Production

As a UX Engineer, this project represents a full-cycle product workflow, ensuring that design intent is preserved with 100% accuracy in the final build:

1. **System Architecture**: Defining a scalable token model that supports CSS, SCSS, JSON, and Tailwind formats.
2. **Logic and State**: Leveraging Zustand for high-performance state management, allowing for instant token manipulation.
3. **UI/UX Implementation**: Utilizing Radix UI and Tailwind CSS to create an accessible, responsive, and predictable user interface.
4. **Engineering Rigor**: Using TypeScript to ensure data integrity during the complex transformation from Figma API schemas to developer outputs.

## Tech Stack

* **Framework**: React (Vite-powered)
* **Language**: TypeScript
* **Backend**: Node.js and Express (API Orchestration)
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
* **Infrastructure**: Vercel (Serverless Architecture)
